## CRITICAL RULE — Read-only by default

When the user shares logs, errors, or bug reports: **ONLY diagnose and explain**. NEVER write code, create branches, open PRs, or make any changes unless the user explicitly asks you to implement a fix. The user often shares the same logs with multiple agents in parallel just for analysis — acting on them without permission wastes time and creates mess to clean up.

**Before making ANY structural or architectural change** (new endpoints, new DAG nodes, new services, schema changes, workflow changes): stop and ask the user for approval first. Never assume the fix belongs in this repo — the root cause may be in another service.

# Project: campaign-service

Campaign CRUD and orchestration service for MCP Factory. Manages campaign lifecycle, budget tracking, and run coordination.

## Log level: expected business states are NOT warnings — and high-frequency routine events are NOT logged at all

A gate block caused by a **normal, expected** business state — out of credits, budget window exceeded, max leads reached — must trace/log at `info`, never `warn`/`error`. Running out of credit happens; it is not an anomaly and it is not campaign-service's job to flag it loudly (billing's dunning engine owns the "out of credit" story). Reserve `warn`/`error` for genuine fail-OPEN/fail-closed anomalies (misconfig, non-2xx from a sibling, unexpected throw). When adding a new gate-check block, decide its trace level by "is this an expected outcome or a fault?" — expected → info. (Set 2026-06-14, credit-affordability gate PR #171: the gate-check-result trace hard-coded `warn` for every BLOCKED result; out-of-credit blocks were surfacing as warnings.)

**Downgrading warn→info is NOT always enough — for a HIGH-FREQUENCY routine event, the right level is NO LOG.** Decide level on TWO axes: (1) expected-vs-fault → picks warn vs info; (2) frequency → a routine event that fires on a per-tick / per-minute cadence for **every** campaign × **every** client (scheduler dedup skips, "still in-flight, rescheduled", poll heartbeats) must not be logged at all — even `info` spams the logs minute-by-minute across the fleet and buries real signal. Ask "how often, across how many entities, does this line fire?" before logging it; if the answer is "every tick for everyone," drop it. The decision is already observable in durable state (persisted `nextRunAt` in DB, trace events) — a per-minute log is the wrong observability mechanism. (Set 2026-06-14, scheduler in-flight skip v0.26.1: first instinct was to downgrade the `console.warn` to `console.log`; Kevin: "tu ne vas pas faire un bip toutes les minutes pour toutes les campagnes, pour tous les clients… ça n'a aucun sens" — the log was deleted, not downgraded.)

## Two distinct "goal" concepts — `activeGoalId` (attribution) vs `campaigns.goal` (pacing). Do NOT conflate.

- **`activeGoalId`** (text, nullable) is an OPAQUE attribution id, threaded downstream as the `x-active-goal-id` header and returned on reads. It **never drives pacing** — no gate-check, workflow pick, or audience selection reads it.
- **`campaigns.goal`** (RuntimeGoal `signup|meetingBooked|purchase`, nullable — added Campaign v2, migration 0039) is the campaign's OWN optimization goal and IS the pacing lever. At `/start-run` and in the scheduler's workflow greedy pick, the runtime goal is `campaign.goal ?? brandRuntimeContext.currentGoal` — the campaign's own goal overrides the brand's `currentGoal` when set, else inherits it (NULL). It's also renderable (3 known values → human labels) and exposed on reads + `/start-run`, so display and runtime agree.
- The brief for Campaign v2 asserted "per-campaign goal runtime is already implemented" — it was NOT. Before 0039, ALL pacing used the brand `currentGoal`; there was no per-campaign goal override. If a future task claims per-campaign goal already paces, verify against `runtimeGoal` resolution in `src/routes/internal.ts` /start-run, not the presence of `activeGoalId`. (Set 2026-07-17, Campaign v2 PR #276.)

The per-campaign audience SUBSET (`campaigns.audience_ids`, Campaign v2) is a HARD filter on the audience bandit (`requiredAudienceIds` in `selectAudienceForRun`): a campaign never contacts an audience outside its targeted subset (no fallback). NULL/empty → inherit the brand's full active audience set. The workflow-conditioning `eligibleAudienceIds` stays a SOFT filter applied WITHIN the hard subset. Distinct from the singular `audienceId` column (per-campaign attribution; the per-RUN chosen audience is re-selected fresh at /start-run).

## Running tests in a fresh workspace

A new Conductor workspace has no built local package and no test DB. Before `pnpm test:integration`:

1. **Build the workspace client first** — `pnpm --filter @distribute/runs-client build`. Without it `tsc`/`vitest` fail with `TS2307 Cannot find module '@distribute/runs-client'` (looks like a code bug, isn't).
2. **Provide a local Postgres** named `campaign_test` — integration tests connect to `postgresql://test:test@localhost/campaign_test` (see `tests/setup.ts`). Create role `test`/`test` + DB, then materialize the schema with **`db:push`, NOT `db:migrate`** — a from-scratch `db:migrate` fails on a historical FK type drift (`campaign_runs.campaign_id uuid` vs `campaigns.id text`, error `42804`). `db:push` uses `schema.ts` (source of truth) directly. Set `CAMPAIGN_SERVICE_DATABASE_URL` for the run.

Unit tests (`pnpm test:unit`) need neither — they fully mock db/runs-client.

**`db:push` HANGS on a column RENAME against an existing `campaign_test`.** drizzle-kit `push` can't tell a rename from a drop+create, so it prompts interactively ("is `audience_id` a rename of `customer_profile_id`?") — in a non-interactive/background shell it blocks forever (produces 0B output, never exits). When a schema change RENAMES a column, don't rely on `db:push` to materialize it on the test DB: apply the `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN` directly (`psql postgresql://test:test@localhost/campaign_test -c '…'`), mirroring the prod migration. `db:push` is still fine for additive changes (new column/table). (Set 2026-06-20, customer_profile_id → audience_id rename.)

**`db:generate` is DEAD in this repo — migrations are HAND-AUTHORED idempotent SQL, do NOT try drizzle-kit generate.** The `drizzle/meta/` snapshots froze at `0023_snapshot.json`; every migration `0024+` was hand-written without updating the snapshot. So `drizzle-kit generate` diffs `schema.ts` against the stale `0023` snapshot and prompts interactively for ~12 migrations' worth of phantom rename/create decisions (e.g. "is `parent_run_id` a rename of `workflow_name`?") — it can never emit a clean single-change migration. When a brief says "generate with drizzle-kit," ignore it for this repo. **To author a new migration: (1) hand-write `drizzle/NNNN_<desc>.sql` mirroring the latest one's boot-safe idempotent style** — `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS` (see `0036`) or a `DO $$ … information_schema … IF EXISTS` guard for renames (see `0035`); **(2) append a journal entry** to `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` with the next sequential `idx`, the matching `tag`, and a synthetic `when` (prior cadence: +100000000 ms per migration). `src/lib/migrations-validator.ts` enforces journal↔sql parity + gap-free sequential `idx` + no dup idx/tag, so both files must be added together. Boot runs `migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: "./drizzle" })`; idempotent guards make every migration re-runnable. (Set 2026-06-20, customer_persona_id DROP / migration 0036.)

## Campaign status enum — a RUNNING campaign is `ongoing`, NOT `active`

`campaigns.status` uses **`ongoing`** for a live/running campaign and **`stopped`** for a halted one. There is NO `active` value. When diagnosing "which campaigns are running / did I stop them all", filter `status='ongoing'` — a query on `status='active'` returns EMPTY and falsely reads as "nothing is running". The scheduler's `reRunDueCampaigns` claims rows where `status='ongoing' AND nextRunAt <= now()`. (Set 2026-07-07: first diagnostic pass filtered `active`, wrongly reported all campaigns stopped while 9 were `ongoing`.)

## Scheduler in-flight guard — check ANY live run for the campaign, never the campaign-service marker

The `campaign-service / <campaignId>` parent run (created by the workflow DAG's start-run) is an **ephemeral ~2s marker** — `start-run → end-run` within seconds — NOT an enclosing span. The genuinely-long work (lead-service `buffer/next`, observed up to **755s**) runs in a separate `lead-service / lead-serve` run that is **not linked** under the marker via `parent_run_id`. So `src/lib/scheduler.ts`'s "is a flow still alive?" check MUST query `listRuns` scoped to **`campaignId` + `status=running` + `startedAfter=freshnessCutoff`** (any service) via `hasLiveRunForCampaign()` — **never** `(serviceName="campaign-service", taskName=campaignId)`, which only sees the 2s corpse and re-fires mid-fill → `lead-service` `409 Concurrent buffer/next` storm. `STUCK_RUN_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD_MS` must stay **strictly greater than** lead-service's max fill (`PULL_NEXT_TIMEOUT` 600s; observed 755s) — currently 15min. `reRunDueCampaigns` and `claimStuckCampaigns` MUST share the same helper. (Set 2026-06-13, v0.25.1 / DIS-277.)

## Execution run tree + audience attribution — propagate forward from /start-run, do NOT root-stamp

Verified prod shape of one execution's run tree (single common ancestor):
```
workflow / execute-workflow      ← ROOT (created by workflow-service at /execute)
 ├─ campaign-service / <campaignId>   (the ~2s marker, parent = execute-workflow)
 └─ lead-service / lead-serve         (the expensive work, parent = execute-workflow)
```
The marker and `lead-serve` are **siblings** — both chain to the `execute-workflow` root. (`lead-serve` is "not linked under the **marker**" per the scheduler note above, but it IS chained to the **root**.) So the per-execution attribution anchor is the `execute-workflow` root, NOT campaign-service's marker — stamping the marker would NOT attribute `lead-serve` (the bulk of spend) via inheritance.

**Audience attribution is FORWARD-PROPAGATED, not root-stamped.** The priority audience (`audience.id` — a human-service saved-filter-set UUID; == the persona/profile id returned by features-service `persona-stats`) is **re-decided every run** inside `/start-run` (`fetchBestCustomerPersona`), which runs AFTER the root is created. So `/start-run`: (1) selects the audience BEFORE `createRun`, stamps `x-audience-id` on its own marker run; (2) returns top-level `audienceId` on its response. workflow-service reads that `audienceId` and threads `x-audience-id` into every downstream node call (`lead-serve`, email, …); runs-service stores `audience_id` per run + cost and exposes `groupBy=audienceId`. Header is byte-equal `x-audience-id` across campaign/workflow/runs services. `customerProfileId`/`x-customer-profile-id` is the deprecated alias for the SAME id — do not use for new work. (Set 2026-06-20, campaign-service#204 + workflow-service#307 + runs-service#154.)

## Per-run selection: GREEDY workflow + Thompson audience-conditioned-on-workflow. Two levers, two decision points.

**Feature scope (2026-07-07): workflow rotation is ENABLED ONLY for `sales-cold-email-outreach`.** `resolveWorkflowSlugForTrigger` gates on `isWorkflowRotationEnabled(featureSlug)` (allowlist `WORKFLOW_ROTATION_FEATURE_SLUGS` in `features-workflow-projection-client.ts`); any other feature (pr-expert-quote-outreach, pr-expert-quote-opportunities, hiring/vc/pr cold-email, etc.) returns `campaign.workflowSlug` immediately — no features-service call, no greedy pick, same workflow every run. The GREEDY-vs-Thompson description below applies to the sales-cold-email-outreach path; for every other feature the workflow leg is a no-op passthrough. (Kevin: "restreint la rotation à la feature sales cold email outreach".)

The campaign picks, per run, WHICH audience to contact and WHICH workflow to run. **The two legs use DIFFERENT policies — that asymmetry is intentional** (`src/lib/bandit.ts` holds both):
- **Workflow leg = GREEDY (exploit-only).** `greedyArgminCost` — score each workflow by its EXPECTED cost-per-success using the posterior MEAN rate `(successes+1)/(trials+2)`, pick `argmin(costPerTrial / meanRate)` deterministically. No exploration: the campaign always runs its current best workflow. (Was Thompson until 2026-06-23; Kevin asked to "take the max instead of a random Thompson".) Cold workflows score at the prior mean 0.5; ties → first index. Do NOT revert to "take features-service rank #1" — greedy over the SAME evidence is the equivalent honest pick; rank-#1 ignores the cost lever.
- **Audience leg = Thompson (still explores), CONDITIONED on the chosen workflow.** `thompsonArgminCost` samples `Beta(successes+1, trials−successes+1)` per arm, picks `argmin(costPerTrial / sampledRate)` — keeps exploring so no audience stays shadowed. The candidate SET is scoped to the audiences that have run under the run's chosen workflow ("explore the best audiences FOR THIS workflow"), not every audience the brand ever contacted.

**Cardinality (verified prod): 1 `/execute` = 1 start-run = 1 `lead-serve`.** The DAG does NOT loop start-run; each run is a brand-new `/execute` (scheduler `/end-run` → `nextRunAt` → next tick re-executes). So "vary the workflow per run" = pass a different slug to the NEXT execute — never a mid-flight DAG switch.

**The two levers live at DIFFERENT code points, and that split is load-bearing:**
- **Workflow** is chosen at the TRIGGER (`scheduler.ts reRunDueCampaigns`, before `executeCampaignWorkflow`) because the workflow is the DAG identity in the `/execute` URL — start-run is too late (the DAG is already running). `resolveWorkflowSlugForTrigger` greedy-picks (`selectWorkflowGreedy`) over features-service `/workflow-projection` `rows[]` (per-workflow evidence; ranks on `row.resolved.costPerOutcomeUsd`). **Fail-soft**: falls back to `campaign.workflowSlug` when there's no evidence or features-service is down — a selection optimization must never block a run. Only `reRunDueCampaigns` triggers (not `claimStuckCampaigns`); campaign create/activate keep the configured slug for the seed run, the scheduler varies it from run 2.
- **Audience** is chosen at `/start-run` (`selectAudienceForRun` Thompson over `/audience-stats`, all `active`, dropped `limit=1`) because workflow-service threads `x-audience-id` to downstream nodes from **start-run's RESPONSE** (`results.startRun.audienceId` in `dag-to-openflow.ts`), NOT from the execute input. start-run MUST keep returning `audienceId`. **Workflow-conditioning**: start-run fetches `/workflow-projection` `rows[]` for the run's chosen workflow (`req.workflowSlug`), derives the audience-grain audienceIds via `audienceIdsForWorkflow` (rows with `audienceId != null` for that `workflowDynastySlug`), and passes them as `eligibleAudienceIds` to restrict the Thompson set. **Fail-soft**: any error, or no audience couples for that workflow (cold workflow) → no restriction, Thompson over all active audiences (a fresh workflow must still get an audience). Evidence + the full audience object (filters) still come from `/audience-stats`; `/workflow-projection` only supplies the workflow→audience membership.

**Downstream honors the choice — already correct, don't rebuild:** lead-service `buffer/next` uses the passed `x-audience-id` and does NOT re-select; human-service suppression is **per-brand atomic, cross-audience** (the serve cursor is per-audience) so overlapping audiences never double-contact. `workflowSlug == workflowDynastySlug` (v1) so the projection row's dynasty slug is executable by `/by-slug/{slug}/execute`.

**Audience grain SHIPPED (features-service#368, prod v0.60.0; grain label renamed `persona`→`audience` in #376, prod v0.62.1):** the projection `rows[]` carry non-null `audienceId` per `(audienceId × workflowDynastySlug)` couple that has audience-attributed runs/outcomes. campaign-service keys on `audienceId != null`. **Caveat — per-workflow OUTCOME splitting does NOT exist yet** (send/engagement untagged by workflow): an audience-grain row's outcome numbers are the audience-level slice (byte-identical to `/audience-stats`), the same across all of that audience's workflow couples. So the projection reliably tells us WHICH audiences ran a workflow (the membership filter), but not how an audience performed *differently* per workflow. Full joint `P(a|w)` evidence (workflow-discriminated audience outcomes) still needs per-workflow outcome tagging upstream (features-service#366/#367, workflow-service#321). (Set 2026-06-23, campaign-service workflow-greedy + audience-conditioning; supersedes the 2026-06-21 #219 "not yet shipped" note.)

**Endpoint migration (2026-07-06):** features-service DELETED `/features/:slug/candidates` and folded its evidence into the reshaped `GET /features/:slug/workflow-projection` (`rows[]` grain-ladder + `resolved`). campaign-service reads `rows[]`, ranks on `row.resolved.costPerOutcomeUsd`, scopes audiences via `row.audienceId`. Client: `src/lib/features-workflow-projection-client.ts` (was `features-candidates-client.ts`). Sends `brandId` + `goal` only (brandProfileId dropped — the new endpoint derives economics from brandId).
